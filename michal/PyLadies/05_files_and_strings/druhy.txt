Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon youâ€™ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
