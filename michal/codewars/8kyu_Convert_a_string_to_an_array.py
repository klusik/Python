# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words. For example:
# "Robin Singh" ==> ["Robin", "Singh"]
# "I love arrays they are my favorite" ==> ["I", "love", "arrays", "they", "are", "my", "favorite"]

def string_to_array(s):
    # your code here
    return s.split(' ')


string_to_array('I love arrays they are my favorite')
