    The goal is to simulate a unbounded population growth
    with added randomness.

    There will be some constants (user input):

        -- probability of birth of every two M/F for another person
        -- age of concieving (all the same)
        -- max age of concieving (all the same)
        -- max age (all the same), after this age random death occurs
